    <h3><u>WORK EXPERIENCE AND EXTRACURRICULARS</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In my free time, I spend my time working on personal programming projects such as making a weather forecast application or Flashcard application as an example.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Prior to University, For a summer project I made an essay about Fourier series and also studied the Laplace transform,
                which strengthened my understanding of the mathematics behind the decomposition of electrical signals,
                being very beneficial to aiding my studies in my degree. The mathematics Iâ€™ve learnt at the time was beyond the scope of
                A-level Further mathematics.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>For a school project, I built a trebuchet along with my peers. I investigated the relationship between the projectile and counterweight,
                considering budget and convenience. I also worked with my group on the arm, whilst collaborating to make sure it fits with the design
                of the pouch and frame; this needed innovation and creative thinking to discover a solution for any challenges during the construction
                of the trebuchet.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Attended a virtual work experience for engineering on Springpod where I was tasked to solve a real-life issue using GPS.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Volunteered as an assistant scout leader, where here I have coached young kids on engaging with fun activities
                and have used my leadership skills to keep order within the group. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>I participated in an acting club and have been featured in two short film projects where I was responsible for deciding, along with my group,
                the outcome of the scenes (committing months of planning) and improvisation during the days of the film shoot.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>I have finished my duke of Edinburgh bronze expedition, improving my decision-making skills along with maintaining morale in the group.</li>
        </ul>
